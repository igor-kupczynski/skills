# AGENTS

This repository stores reusable skills for coding agents.
We learn together: if an agent finds something especially interesting, unexpected, or a hard-won lesson, add it here so future runs benefit.

## Conventions

- Keep each skill in its own directory under `skills/`.
- Include a `SKILL.md` file with clear instructions.
- Keep examples small and practical.

## Lessons

- Add notable discoveries and hard-won lessons here as short, practical notes.
