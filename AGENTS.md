# AGENTS

This repository stores reusable skills for coding agents.
We learn together: if an agent finds something especially interesting, unexpected, or a hard-won lesson, add it here so future runs benefit.

## Conventions

- Keep each skill in its own directory under `skills/`.
- Include a `SKILL.md` file with clear instructions and YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) delimited by `---`.
- Keep examples small and practical.
- **When creating or updating a skill**, update the skills table in `README.md` (between `<!-- BEGIN SKILLS -->` and `<!-- END SKILLS -->` markers). Read each `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter to rebuild the table.

## Lessons

- Add notable discoveries and hard-won lessons here as short, practical notes.
